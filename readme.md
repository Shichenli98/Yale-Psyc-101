As recommended by the instructor, some books can serve as tutorials:

Published by Worth Publishers, 2007 edition.
This book provides a comprehensive overview of psychology, covering various aspects of the field, including perception, communication, learning, memory, decision-making, and more. It is likely to serve as the primary textbook for the course, offering in-depth explanations of concepts and theories.

- **"The Norton Psychology Reader", by Gary Marcus**: Published by W. W. Norton & Company, 2006.
As an edited volume, this reader likely compiles key articles and writings in psychology. It's designed to supplement the main textbook by providing additional perspectives and insights from various authors in the field.
